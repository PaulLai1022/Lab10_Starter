ok I have tried everything everything I can but there's still nothing show up on my analytic page. I have ensured the measurement ID check, the code is inputted correctly and in the right position. All green marks have checked and they are connected to each other. Both features are on fired. But still, nothing show up in the analytic page. I have attached relevant screenshots to prove that I have done everything and seek any help I can find. Please just give me full credits on this one...
